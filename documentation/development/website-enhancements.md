## Implementation Notes

### Reading Time Calculation

- Integrates with existing Python metadata generation pipeline
- Word count excludes YAML frontmatter, markdown formatting, and HTML tags
- Average reading speed of 225 WPM can be configured
- Graceful fallback to "1 min read" if calculation fails

### Related Posts Algorithm

- Uses semantic embeddings for content similarity
- Boosts scores for posts sharing categories (+0.1 per common category)
- Boosts scores for posts sharing tags (+0.05 per common tag)
- Excludes current post from recommendations
- Configurable similarity threshold (default: 0.15)
- Falls back to category/tag matching if semantic search fails

### Print Optimization

- Designed for A4 paper with 1-inch margins
- Uses CSS `@page` rules for headers and footers
- Implements orphan/widow control for better typography
- Optimized for black and white printing
- Removes all interactive elements and animations

## Technical Architecture

### Dependencies

- **@xenova/transformers**: Client-side AI embeddings for semantic search
- **dayjs**: Date manipulation for post sorting and formatting
- **Vue 3**: Component framework
- **Vuetify 3**: UI component library
- **Nuxt 3**: Meta-framework for static generation

### Performance Considerations

- Search index with embeddings is generated at build time
- Client-side semantic search avoids server dependencies
- Related posts calculation is cached per session
- Print styles use CSS-only approach for maximum compatibility

### Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES2020 support
- WebAssembly support required for Transformers.js
- Graceful degradation for print styles in older browsers

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements

1. **Server-side rendering** for related posts to improve initial load
2. **Search result caching** with service workers
3. **Reading progress persistence** across sessions
4. **Social sharing integration** with post reactions
5. **Email newsletter automation** with RSS feeds
6. **Comment moderation** with AI assistance
7. **Content recommendation** based on reading history
8. **Performance monitoring** for search and related posts

### Accessibility Enhancements

1. **Screen reader support** for reading progress
2. **Keyboard navigation** for related posts
3. **High contrast mode** for print styles
4. **ARIA labels** for all interactive elements
