## Project Architecture

This is a personal website and blog built with Nuxt 4 and Vue 3. The main application lives in the `website/` directory.

### Key Directory Structure

- `website/` - Main Nuxt 4 application
  - `app/` - **Nuxt 4 structure** - Contains client-side code
    - `components/` - Vue components organized by feature (about, blog, home-page, etc.)
    - `pages/` - File-based routing with dynamic blog post pages
    - `layouts/` - Layout components
    - `plugins/` - Client-side plugins (includes error handlers)
    - `stores/` - Pinia stores for state management
    - `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers (including topic extraction)
    - `composables/` - Vue composables
    - `style/` - SCSS style files
    - `app.vue` - Main app component
  - `config/` - Configuration files including topic extraction data
  - `public/` - Static assets and generated blog content
  - `scripts/` - Python scripts for topic extraction, metadata generation
  - `server/` - Server-side code (API routes, sitemap, RSS feed)
  - `nuxt.config.ts` - Main configuration file
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with strict mode
  - `volar.config.js` - Vue tooling configuration

- `blog/` - Blog post source files in markdown format, organized by year/month/day
- `documentation/` - Project documentation
- `scripts/` - Root-level shell scripts for setup and maintenance
- `public/blogdata/` - Mirror of blog content for static generation

### Blog System Architecture

- Blog posts are stored as markdown files in `blog/YYYY/MM/DD/post-name/readme.md`
- Python scripts generate enhanced metadata with unified AI-powered topic extraction:
  - `website/scripts/create_blog_metadata.py` - Core metadata generation with hybrid extraction
  - `website/scripts/transformer_topic_extraction.py` - **NEW** Unified transformer-based extraction
  - `website/scripts/enhanced_topic_extraction.py` - Enhanced hybrid static/dynamic analysis
  - `website/scripts/topic_discovery.py` - Traditional clustering for fallback
- Static routes are generated dynamically based on blog post structure
- RSS feed and sitemap generation handled via Nuxt hooks
- Search index generation for full-text blog search
- JSON-LD structured data for enhanced SEO

### Key Configuration Files

- `website/nuxt.config.ts` - Main Nuxt configuration with PWA, sitemap, feed, and prerendering
- `website/package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `website/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with strict compilation
- `website/volar.config.js` - Vue tooling configuration
- `website/config/topic-extraction-data.json` - ML topic extraction configuration
- `renovate.json` - Dependency update automation
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - CI/CD with topic extraction automation
