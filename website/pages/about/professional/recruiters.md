### What I bring to the table?

- Nearly two decades years of industry experience in established companies as well as startups.
- Proven track record of building, growing, supporting and leading organizations of high technical caliber.
- Proven track record of building and scaling enterprise products used in critical industrial infrastructure across the world.
- Experience leading and running teams and organizations both co-located and remote / distributed.
- Experience running organizations spread across different continents.
- A highly systemizing nature. Very methodical and meticulous.
- Excellent communication and collaboration skills.
- Strong bias for action and a laser focus on providing results.
- Strong sense of ownership and very hard working.
- Standing in the industry. I have several [professional engagements](/about/professional/engagements/) beyond my day job, including organizational memberships and affiliations, public speaking, technical reviewer, etc. This tends to bring additional positive visibility to the company I work for.

### What value will I provide?

- Strong technical background coupled with strong engineering leadership.
- Ability to sift through ambiguity and bring _order to chaos_.
- Ability to keep track of multiple threads and ensure progress on all of them.
- Compelling ability to provide results under challenging circumstances.
- Strong multiplier affect on people around me.

### What would interest me?

- A role heading the engineering organization for an earlier stage startup <!--(ideally series A or B)--> with growth trajectory. This includes VP / Head of Engineering, CTO roles.
- Solving problems broadly at the intersection of **AI/ML and large-scale systems**.
- Working with people who value hard work, integrity, trust and mutual respect.
- The reward of going on a journey towards collective accomplishment.

### What compensation package am I hoping for?

- Cash component that will allow me to keep paying bills. I may be willing to take a base pay cut depending on other variables.
- An annual bonus at 25-30% of base pay.
- An options package at an attractive strike price and exercise timeline. **Note**: If the startup is still in seed round, I would expect attractive percentage equity.
- Additional annual performance based stock grants.
<!-- - Stock grants vesting cycle being over 4 years. One year initial vesting cliff is acceptable if subsequent vests happen every month or with each pay cycle.
- Nice to haves:
  - 401(k) matching.
  - Support / reimbursement for membership of professional organizations such as IEEE, ACM, etc.
  - Support / reimbursement for attending conferences. I would of course be willing to speak at conferences on behalf of the company.
  - Wellness / gym membership stipend.
  - Performance based out-of-band cash bonuses. -->

### Miscellaneous

- Due to US legal immigration system being where it is, I still do not have my green card. So, I will need immigration support. Specifically, H1B and continuing my GC application. Happy to discuss specifics.
- I have worked in in-person, hybrid as well as remote working environments. I am comfortable and have been successful in all of them. I am open to any of these working environments. For in-person, I would appreciate the option of working remotely on occasion.
