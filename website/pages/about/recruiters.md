[**Note**: I am not looking for any new opportunity at this time.]

### What I bring to the table?

- Over 16 years of industry experience in established companies as well as startups.
- Proven track record of building, growing, supporting and leading organizations of high technical caliber.
- Proven track record of building and scaling products used in critical industrial infrastructure across the world.
- Experience leading teams and organizations both co-located and remote / distributed.
- A highly systemizing nature. Very methodical and meticulous.
- Excellent communication and collaboration skills.
- Strong bias for action.
- Strong sense of ownership and very hard working.

### What value will I provide?

- Strong technical background coupled with strong engineering leadership.
- Ability to sift through ambiguity and bring _order to chaos_.
- Ability to keep track of multiple threads and ensure progress on all of them.
- Compelling ability to provide results under challenging circumstances.
- Strong multiplier affect on people around me.

### What would interest me?

- A role heading the engineering organization for an earlier stage startup (ideally series A or B) with growth trajectory.
- Solving problems broadly at the intersection of **large-scale distributed systems, data infrastructure and AI/ML**.
- Working with people who value hard work, integrity, trust and mutual respect.
- The reward of going on a journey towards collective accomplishment.

### What compensation package am I hoping for?

- Cash component that will allow me to keep paying bills. I may be willing to take a base pay cut depending on other variables.
- An annual bonus at 25-30% of base pay.
- A generous options package at an attractive strike price and exercise timeline. **Note**: If the startup is still in seed round, I will expect attractive percentage equity.
- Additional annual performance based stock grants.

### Miscellaneous

- Due to US legal immigration system being where it is, I still do not have my green card even after being in this country for over 18 years. So, I will need immigration support. Specifically, H1B and continuing my GC application. Happy to discuss specifics.
- I am mostly an in-person, work-from-office person. However, it would be nice to have the flexibility to work remotely on occasion.
