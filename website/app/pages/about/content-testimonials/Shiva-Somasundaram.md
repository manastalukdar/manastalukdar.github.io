I had the opportunity to work closely with Manas Talukdar as he led engineering for my Data & ML Platform product area at C3 AI. Manas is an exceptional engineering leader—clear in his thinking, strong in execution, and consistently focused on building scalable, high-quality platform capabilities. He effectively translated product goals into sound architectural decisions and ensured his team delivered reliably, even in complex and ambiguous environments.

Manas also stands out for his people leadership. He cultivates a culture of ownership and transparency, supports his team’s growth, and unblocks cross-functional work with ease.

Manas is one of the most dependable and impactful engineering managers I’ve partnered with, and I recommend him without hesitation and would look forward to working with him again in the future.
