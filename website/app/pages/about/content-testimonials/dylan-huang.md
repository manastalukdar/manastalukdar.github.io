"I had the privilege of working under Manas’s leadership at C3.ai, where I witnessed firsthand his exceptional organizational skills and passion for engineering excellence. When Manas joined our team, we were facing a daunting array of tasks with little structure in place to manage them. With remarkable efficiency and dedication, he took the reins, swiftly organizing our team to maximize productivity and minimize distractions.

Manas’s ability to grow our team by fourfold while maintaining a culture of efficiency was nothing short of impressive. His deep understanding of engineering best practices and adeptness at managing large-scale projects with multiple stakeholders consistently stood out. Under his guidance, our team not only expanded in size but also in capability and cohesion.

Manas is the epitome of a reliable and effective engineering leader, someone who can be trusted to foster growth and drive efficiency in any engineering organization. His contributions to our team were invaluable, and I am confident that he will bring the same level of excellence and dedication to any future role he undertakes. If you are looking for a leader who can effectively grow and manage an efficient engineering team, Manas is your go-to professional."
