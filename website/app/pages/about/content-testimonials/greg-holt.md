"Manas and I have known each other for almost a decade now. Even before I came to work with him I was aware of his reputation as a solid developer. Once we started working together, I saw that not only was he a strong developer, but he was also a skilled Software Engineering Leader. He and I worked together side-by-side on the kick off of several initiatives, including initiatives relating to distributed systems and edge processing, all related to large-scale data products and services.

I've always been impressed at Manas's ability to lead by being a servant leader of those he was responsible for. I would welcome the opportunity to work with Manas again and I highly recommend him to anyone seeking a solid, seasoned Software Leader."
