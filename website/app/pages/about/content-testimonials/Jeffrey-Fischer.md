"I endorse Manas as a strong technical leader, having worked with him for several years at C3. He was critical to the initial launch of the C3 AI Platform's Feature Store, contributing to its core design and leading the engineering team to a successful, on-time delivery. Beyond this key initiative, Manas consistently managed and delivered on complex projects across the Data area. His leadership and technical expertise would be a great asset to any engineering organization."
