"Manas and I worked on a proof of concept trial for a customer in the Solar Power Industry. I still to this day am impressed by his hard work and dedication as it entailed the scripting of our UFL Interface. The work was complicated by the simple fact that there was no function to handle Julian based timestamps in that version of the interface; this combined with the fact the UFL interface is the most difficult interface available. The work he did, the testing, and the report he sent to development so that the Julian date function could be added to the interface design elevated Manas, to top of the list of engineers that I have worked with. Without his vision and dedication to the task at hand, the sale may have not been possible as this data was critical to the customers needs."
