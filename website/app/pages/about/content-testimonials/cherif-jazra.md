"I've had the pleasure of working with Manas at C3 AI and delivering a product at the intersection of Data infrastructure and Machine Learning. Manas led and grew the data organization from a small number of engineers to a group consisting of multiple teams delivering a very complex set of core capabilities for the platform department, and in the process proved to be an excellent manager of junior and senior engineers, team leads, and managers. He is able to challenge his teams in positive ways and always has their interest and health as his utmost concern and focus. He is able to build deep connections across organizations, create consensus amongst them, and deliver on his goal in practical and realistic terms. Manas greatly values open and transparent communication as well as setting clear and realistic expectations, which he conveys on a regular basis. He is a trustworthy partner to the people who report to him as well as to external partners and always keeps his door open and listens to concerns. He has a friendly and calm composure, brings a lot of humanity to his role, and is able to keep it even during time of great organizational challenges. I wholeheartedly recommend Manas and would not hesitate at the opportunity of working together again!"
