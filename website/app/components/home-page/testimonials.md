"Manas and I have known each other for almost a decade now... Once we started working together, I saw that not only was he a strong developer, but he was also a skilled Software Engineering Leader... I've always been impressed at Manas's ability to lead by being a servant leader of those he was responsible for. I would welcome the opportunity to work with Manas again and I highly recommend him to anyone seeking a solid, seasoned Software Leader."

"I’ve had the pleasure of working with Manas at C3 AI and delivering a product at the intersection of Data infrastructure and Machine Learning. Manas led and grew the data organization from a small number of engineers to a group consisting of multiple teams delivering a very complex set of core capabilities for the platform department, and in the process proved to be an excellent manager of junior and senior engineers, team leads, and managers... He has a friendly and calm composure, brings a lot of humanity to his role, and is able to keep it even during time of great organizational challenges. I wholeheartedly recommend Manas and would not hesitate at the opportunity of working together again!"

"Manas and I worked on a proof of concept trial for a customer in the Solar Power Industry. I still to this day am impressed by his hard work and dedication... Without his vision and dedication to the task at hand, the sale may have not been possible as this data was critical to the customers needs."
