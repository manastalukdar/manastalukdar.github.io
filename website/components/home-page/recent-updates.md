#### Reading

- **Production-Ready Microservices**: I recently read the book, [Production-Ready Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053675.do). This book has some good pointers on what it takes to run "operations for live services". It is authored by an ex-Uber employee. Chapters 5 and 6 are specially relevant to Operations. Even if Service Operations is not of particular interest, it still makes for an interesting read from a Distributed SystemsÂ perspective, specifically what it takes to build and run a distributed systems service in production.

#### Work

- **Cloud Services**: I currently manage a team working on large-scale distributed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) metadata solutions for storage and analysis of high-throughput streaming data to enable asset management using context for industrial applications.

#### Other

- **Website Migration**: Migrated this website to [Vuetify 2.0](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
