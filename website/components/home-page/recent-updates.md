#### Reading

- **Production-Ready Microservices**: I recently read the book, [Production-Ready Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053675.do). This book has some good pointers on what it takes to run "operations for live services". It is authored by an ex-Uber employee. Chapters 5 and 6 are specially relevant to Operations. Even if Service Operations is not of particular interest, it still makes for an interesting read from a Distributed SystemsÂ perspective, specifically what it takes to build and run a distributed systems service in production.

#### Work

- **Cloud Services**: I currently manage a team working on large-scale distributed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) metadata solutions for storage and analysis of high-throughput streaming data to enable asset management using context for industrial applications.

#### Other

- **Learning Go, gRPC, Protocol Buffers**: I am currently working on a personal hobby project based on Go, gRPC, Protocol Buffers. More than anything else, I am using the project as a medium to learn these technologies. More to follow as and when I have built something usable.
- **Markdown-it Parser Plugin**: Developed a new Markdown-it [plugin](https://github.com/manastalukdar/markdown-it-textual-uml) to create uml diagrams from text, based on offerings such as plantuml, mermaid, etc.
