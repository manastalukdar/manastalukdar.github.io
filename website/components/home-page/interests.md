- **Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing**: I am interested in the design, architecture and organizational challenges of distributed systems. I enjoy working on problems involving scale, data consistency, availability, resiliency, reliability, microservices, and how to build and run teams that solve these problems. I have extensive experience with public cloud platforms, specifically Microsoft Azure. I am very familiar with Amazon Web Services and I have a good grasp of distributed systems technologies in the open source domain.

- **Data Infrastructure**: I have a general interest in concepts around data storage, database technologies and data processing, specifically in the context of large-scale distributed systems, with a focus on real-time high-throughput streaming data. I have significant experience building and running teams in these areas.

- **Building and running high performing engineering teams**: I am interested and experienced in building high performing engineering teams by hiring and retaining top talent. I follow an agile data driven approach to project management for timely and consistent delivery of results. This includes close collaboration with cross-functional stakeholders and mining project metadata to drive team velocity. My team management philosophy is based on a mentoring and coaching approach to drive individual career growth for my team members. At the end of the day, I find it gratifying to see someone I hired, mentored and coached ramp up to become a productive software engineer, build something as part of my team or a greater organization, that provides value to users and drives customer success.

- **Technology**: I love technology in general and I am always on the lookout for any new development in the industry that I could learn out of inquisitiveness, personal interest or potentially apply at work if relevant.

- **Hiking**: I love nature and like to go on hikes around the San Francisco Bay Area. I particularly enjoy the redwood forests in California.
