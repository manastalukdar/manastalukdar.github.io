- _More than 14 years of industry experience_, including as individual contributor, hands-on development lead and product owner. Focus in recent years on _engineering leadership_ and _driving organizational growth_.

- Recently established the Data org within Platform engineering department. Grew a team of 6 to an org of ~20 engineers across 3 teams. Defined charter for each team. Identified, mentored and promoted senior engineers to lead roles for each team.

- Fueled rapid growth of multiple teams by formulating strategies and processes around hiring. Developed successful cross-departmental collaborations to _scale multiple software teams_ across engineering department. As part of _department leadership_ instituted frameworks and best practices to maintain high bar and _streamline rapid growth_ across multiple teams. Experienced in hiring and mentoring engineers, _identifying and developing leaders_. Trained in management methodologies from UC Berkeley Center for Executive Education.

- Excellent communication skills. _Successful collaborations_ with with cross-functional stakeholders including users, executives, product management, services and support, etc. Gathered requirements, identified new product opportunities, managed backlogs and road-maps. _Drove adoption_ across multiple releases. Proven track record in delivering projects that involved learning new technologies.

- Skilled in Agile methodologies, measuring and improving engineering productivity.

- Bootstrapped multiple projects from ideation to product. Determined scope and drove road-map with stakeholders, including customers. _Built, managed and grew multiple teams_ that consistently delivered on committed milestones. Instilled software engineering best practices.

- Early in Engineering Manager role, created high-value engineering team that developed high-visibility, _large-scale distributed data platform_ product which spawned next-generation series of enterprise software solutions.

- Successfully completed research project and developed prototype of a large-scale distributed data store for _processing billions of streams_ from millions of industrial devices and IoT sensors, that I subsequently took to product stage as Engineering Manager.

- As individual contributor, developed on-prem middleware as well as large enterprise scale, multi-tenant, distributed, micro-services based cloud applications. Developed both front-end UI and back-end infrastructure for PaaS and SaaS products, with focus on back-end. Architected and developed several automated product test, release and delivery systems. Worked throughout the stack, from using front-end frameworks to develop modern web apps, to back-end development, including storage, access layers, API and middleware SDK. Focus and interest primarily in the back-end, specifically in distributed systems, cloud computing and AI/ML platforms.
