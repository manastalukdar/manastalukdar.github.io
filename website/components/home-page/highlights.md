- Bootstrapped multiple projects from ideation to product. Determined scope and road-map with stakeholders (including customers) and built teams that consistently delivered on committed milestones.

- Created high-value engineering team that developed a high-visibility product which spawned vNext series of enterprise solutions.

- Successfully completed research project and developed prototype of a large-scale distributed data store for real-time operational data from millions of industrial devices and IoT sensors, that I subsequently took to product stage as Engineering Manager.

- Worked throughout the stack, from using front-end frameworks to develop modern web apps to back-end development including storage, access layers, API and middleware SDK. Focus and interest primarily in the back-end, specifically in distributed systems and cloud computing.
