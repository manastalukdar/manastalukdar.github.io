- Bootstrapped multiple projects from ideation to product. Determined scope and drove road-map with stakeholders, including customers. Built and managed and grew teams that consistently delivered on committed milestones. Instilled software engineering best practices.

- Created high-value engineering team that developed high-visibility, large-scale distributed data platform product which spawned vNext series of enterprise software solutions.

- Successfully completed research project and developed prototype of a large-scale distributed data store for processing billions of streams from millions of industrial devices and IoT sensors, that I subsequently took to product stage as Engineering Manager.

- Worked throughout the stack, from using front-end frameworks to develop modern web apps, to back-end development, including storage, access layers, API and middleware SDK. Focus and interest primarily in the back-end, specifically in distributed systems and cloud computing.

- Software engineering polyglot. Very comfortable in C# and Java. Comfortable in Python, Javascript, Typescript. Learning Go. Worked with C, C++ in academic projects and early on in career.

- Sharp focus on operational excellence to ensure customer success and satisfy SLA requirements.
