# Interviewing Engineering Managers

${toc}

## Overview

This post described a framework for interviewing engineering managers through multiple rounds. This framework is based on:

- my own experiences both as an individual contributor and later on in engineering management / leadership,
- observations in the industry,
- discussions with friends and colleagues, and
- interviewing many engineering manager candidates.

At this time, I have broken down the interview into 3 rounds, but I think there is scope for fitting in one more round in there - I will likely revisit this in the future and update the post at that point.

## Behavioral Skills

### Communication Skills [Round 1] [Round 2] [Round 3]

- How well does the candidate communicate?
- How well does candidate convey technical information?
- Does candidate dive deep and into specifics?
- Is candidate concise and to-the-point?
- Was candidate able to get their point across and was responding accurately to questions. Communication can be both written and verbal; the candidate's resume is a sample of their ability to communicate in written form.
- Typically, ask the candidate
  - to give a summary of their work experiences, focusing on last few years. [Round 3]
  - to talk about their most impactful project. [Round 2]

### Context on Job Switch [Round 3]

- Why are you looking for a new job?
- Why `<this company>` and what do you know about `<this company>`?
- What are your looking for in next job? What are you looking for in terms of career growth?

### Inquisitiveness, Ability to Learn New Things and Generally Always Looking to Improve [Round 3]

- How do you keep yourself updated with new developments in the technological landscape?
- What is something new (technical) you have learnt recently?
- Does candidate have a mindset of continuous improvement? Does the candidate actively seek out opportunities to learn new skills? Is candidate approaching the interview process as a discussion and opportunity to learn something.

### Awareness [Round 1] [Round 2] [Round 3]

- Receptive to feedback for self and team.
- Exhibits ability to learn and improve.
- Has an idea of their strengths and weaknesses.

### Empathy [Round 1] [Round 2] [Round 3]

Has the ability to understand others' perspectives?

### Passion and Sense of Ownership [Round 1] [Round 2] [Round 3]

- Tell me about one technical problem you solved that you particularly recall and how did you solve it?
- Tell me about your most impactful project.

### Not Afraid to Take on Challenges [Round 1] [Round 2] [Round 3]

Evaluate the candidate's desire to tackle problems of significant complexity. Look for history of working on challenges projects and innovating novel solutions.

### Will Speak Up and Proffer Positive Change [Round 1] [Round 2] [Round 3]

- Looks for signs of candidate improving processes and proposing best practices in previous jobs.
- Does candidate make things better? Does candidate bring about positive change?
- Does candidate challenge the status-quo and proffer positive change, while doing so in a positive / diplomatic manner? Keep in mind not to confuse this with insubordination or going off in different direction or not bring a team player, which are different things.
- Will candidate bring good ideas to the table?

### Tenacity and Resoluteness [Round 1] [Round 2] [Round 3]

- Will candidate give up when things get tough?
- How does candidate deal with failure?

### Culture Fit [Round 1] [Round 2] [Round 3]

- Is candidate curious?
- Is candidate hard-working?
- Does candidate have a generally positive and can-do attitude?

## Technical Competency

### Programming Languages of Choice and Self-Rating in Decreasing Order of Skills [Round 1]

Ask candidate to rate self on top n programming languages of choice. This is more of a check for self-awareness.

### Data Structures and Algorithms [Round 1]

A coding exercise to test for code competency. Does not need to be at the same level as a senior IC, but candidate must exhibit ability to understand problem by identifying the correct algorithm. A problem at difficulty level between easy to medium would be apt. Working code must be provided, even if candidate needs few hints along the way. Candidate should also be able to reason through time and space complexity.

### Systems Design [Round 2]

Candidate must exhibit a strong understanding of large-scale distributed systems. This may include things like consistency models, CAP theorem, retry handling, pub-sub architectures, etc. A typical way to probe for this may be to have candidate give a rundown of a relevant project from their resume. Another approach could be asking candidate about a specific distributed systems problem and seed a discussion from there touching on multiple concepts. Candidate does not necessarily need to have a direct answer, but needs to demonstrate:

- strong understanding of distributed systems.
- ability ot hold their own in a technical conversation.
- ability to ask the right questions.

### Experience with Public Cloud Platforms and/or Open-Source Big-Data Technologies [Round 2]

Probe candidate on experience with public cloud platforms and open-source big-data technologies.

### How Hands-on [Round 3]

- Does candidate still write code, even if not daily?
- Does candidate do code reviews?
- What sort of development tickets does candidate work on?
- What percentage of candidate's time is spent on coding, design discussions, etc.?
- Is candidate interested in keeping their technical skills intact (to some degree)?

### Experience in Providing Technical Direction (even as an IC) [Round 3]

- Data driven decisions.
- Ability to convince others.
- Following-through.
- Dealing with setbacks.

## Managerial Skills

### Motivation – Why Manager (and not IC) [Round 3]

Candidate should have decided to become a manager for the right reasons. We absolutely want to avoid individuals who decide on a managerial track because they might not have been good coders, and/or they think it is easier than being an IC.
Some acceptable answers may be:

- Likes helping developers with career development.
- Likes cross-functional collaboration.
- Likes building teams.
- Likes hiring / mentoring developers.
- Likes having a sense of ownership / responsibility over a product.

### Key Values / Tenets [Round 3]

What are some of the key values / tenets candidate establishes in their team? In general, what is their leadership style / philosophy.

- Are they able to identify a potential problem before it even develops into a problem?
- Do they have a plan for helping any dev get out of a rut?
  - Dev plan – an informal improvement plan.

#### Expectations from a Senior Level Engineer [Round 1]

What attributes and signals would candidate expect from a senior level candidate in their team? In terms of technical competency, leadership, mentoring?

#### Promoting Developers [Round 3]

What is candidate's process around promoting developers? What would candidate do if a junior dev who has been around for around 1.5 years in a 1:1 says that s/he would like to get promoted to a senior dev?

- Ideally, we would like to see candidate anticipate this sort of situation where they have already been working with said individual on a career development plan.
- A dev should ideally be exhibited expected signals for a level at which point they get promoted to that level, so they are set up for success.
- Candidate should exhibit an approach where they work with the dev with a specific promotion plan. Regular check-ins are necessary so that any course correction can be made if needed.
