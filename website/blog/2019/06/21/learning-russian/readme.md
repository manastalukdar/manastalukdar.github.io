I have started learning Russian recently. Growing up I read a lot of Russian literature (English translations). Works of Chekhov, Tolstoy, Gorky, Dostoevsky, Sholokhov, etc. I grew up forming a picture of Russia and the Russian people through my readings. I always wanted to be able to speak Russian and perhaps someday visit the country itself. While I still have not visited Russia yet, I figured this is as good a time as any to start learning the language. I am using the following resources during my journey to learn Russian:

- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)
- [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/)
- [A great resource for learning the alphabet](http://i.imgur.com/Jumb6Nj.png)
- [Beelinguapp](https://beelinguapp.com/)
- [Russian-English keyboard stickers](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NPJMFZ5/)
