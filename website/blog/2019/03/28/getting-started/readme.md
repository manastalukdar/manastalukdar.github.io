Welcome to my blog. I recently built this website, with blog. I learnt [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)](https://nuxtjs.org/) for this project and it was a lot of fun. The UI components for this site uses the material design based [Vuetify.js](https://vuetifyjs.com/) framework. This is an evolving website. The code and backlog for this project is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/manastalukdar/manastalukdar.github.io). At some point I hope to write posts elaborating the design and implementation details behind the website.
