Welcome to my blog. I recently built this website, with blog. I learnt Vue.js and Nuxt.js for this project and it was a lot of fun. This is an evolving website. The code and backlog for this project is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/manastalukdar/manastalukdar.github.io). At some point I hope to write posts elaborating the design and implementation details behind the website.
