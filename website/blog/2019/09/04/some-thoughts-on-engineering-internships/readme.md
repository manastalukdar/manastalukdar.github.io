# Some Thoughts on Engineering Internships

${toc}

## Goal

The goal for an engineering internship should be that the intern can accomplish something that s/he can put on their resume and would be a value-addition for their career. To that end, efforts should be made so that the intern is able to work on end-to-end project(s) that they can take from start to completion.

## Mentoring

Assigning a technical mentor to the intern from the same team should be compulsory. This is an opportunity for the intern to get a helping hand and also for the mentor to get some mentoring and leadership experience. The Engineering Manager (EM) should have a discussion with the mentor at the very beginning or perhaps even before the intern starts, on possible projects for the intern.

## Setting Expectations

The EM during the beginning of the internship should have a frank discussion and set expectations with the intern. These expectations should cover:

1. What the intern hopes to get out of the internship.
2. What the EM hopes the intern will gain from the internship.
3. What the intern and his EM can agree on for the internship to be deemed successful.

## Regular Feedback

The EM should get regular feedback from the assigned mentor as well as the intern so any course corrections can be done sooner rather than later. Midway through the internship, a formal evaluation should be done to document if things are still on track.

## General Career Guidance

Guidance should be provided to the intern on (this should be orchestrated at a broader company, or organization level):

1. Resume preparation.
2. LinkedIn profile creation, updating, etc.
3. Interviewing as new grads. Some things that can be covered could include:
   1. Technical interview preparation. Resources, study plan, etc.
   2. Behavioral interview preparation.
   3. What does it take for a new grad candidate to be successful during a tech interview, in the tech industry in general, and at this company specifically.

## Final Wrap-up

At the end of the internship, the EM should:

1. Solicit formal feedback from both the intern and his/her mentor for each other.
2. Revisit the talking points from the discussion with the intern during their start and determine if the internship was successful. The intern should also provide feedback to the EM on whether s/he considers the internship to have been a success and what s/he go out of it.
