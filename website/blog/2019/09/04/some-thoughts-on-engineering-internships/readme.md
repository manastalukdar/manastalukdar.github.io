# Some Thoughts on Engineering Internships

1. Effort should be made so that the intern is able to work on end-to-end project(s) that they can take from start to completion.
2. The goal should be that the intern can accomplish something that s/he can put on their resume and would be a value-addition for their career.
3. Assigning a technical mentor to the intern from the same team should be compulsory. This is an opportunity for the intern to get a helping hand and also for the mentor to get some mentoring and leadership experience. The EM should have a discussion with the mentor at the very beginning or perhaps even before the intern starts, on possible projects for the intern.
4. The Engineering Manager (EM) should get regular feedback from the assigned mentor as well as the intern so any course corrections can be done sooner rather than later.
5. The EM during the beginning of the internship should have a frank discussion and set expectations with the intern. These expectations should cover:
   1. What does the intern hopes to get out of the internship.
   2. What the EM hopes the intern will gain from the internship.
   3. What the intern and his EM can agree on for the internship to be deemed successful.
6. Midway through the internship, an evaluation should be done to find out if things are still on track.
7. Guidance should be provided to the intern on (this should be orchestrated at a broader company, or organization level):
   1. Resume preparation.
   2. LinkedIn profile creation, updating, etc.
   3. Interviewing as new grads. Some things that can be covered could include:
      1. Technical interview preparation. Resources, study plan, etc.
      2. Behavioral interview preparation.
      3. What does it take for a new grad candidate to be successful during a tech interview, in the tech industry in general, and at this company specifically.
8. At the end of the internship, the EM should
   1. Solicit feedback from both the intern and his/her mentor for each other.
   2. Revisit the talking points from the discussion with the intern during their start and determine if the internship was successful. The intern should also provide feedback to the EM on whether he/she considers the internship to have been a success and what s/he go out of it.
