# Growing and Developing Software Engineering Teams

${toc}

A big aspect of Engineering Leadership is growing and developing teams. This is a multi-faceted task that involves a multitude of things. This article will discuss my approach as an Engineering Manager.

## Setting Expectations

I think it is very important to have **well defined roles** within a team and **set very clear expectations** of these roles with each developer in the team depending on his/her role. So for instance, the contours of a role and the expectations from a _Software Developer I_ are different from that of a _Staff Software Developer_. This should be a conversation that the Engineering Manager (EM) has with each employee. This should also be taken into account when developing quarterly/yearly goals and career progression plans, as we will discuss below.

## Identifying and Addressing Gaps

It is the responsibility of the EM to identity gaps within the team.

For the team as a whole this can take the following forms:

- Gap in certain domain expertise. Perhaps the team lacks someone who could take ownership of DevOps. Or, maybe the team does not have anyone who could bring in prior industry experience with microservices.
- Gap in experience level. Maybe there are too many new grad hires in the team^[Which should not have happened in the first place.]. Maybe the team has mostly highly experiences developers^[Which might not necessarily be a bad thing.].

For individual employees this can be:

- Lack of industry experience for a new grad hire.
- Lack of know-how in a certain tech stack. Maybe an employee has worked with on-premises software before and has not has exposure to cloud and distributed systems.

Subsequently, the EM should identify means to address these gaps, for both teams and individual employees.

For the team this could mean hiring developers, helping current developers learn new technologies, etc. For individuals this could imply helping them ramp up by mentoring, providing learning resources, etc.

## Hiring

A big part of the Engineering Leadership role is hiring new employees. This involves:

- Identifying gaps and needs (discussed above).
- Working with the recruiting organization to develop a hiring plan.
- Developing a methodology for interviewing software engineers. I have discussed this in details in an earlier [blog post](https://manastalukdar.github.io/blog/2019/04/14/interviewing-software-engineers/).
- Identifying individuals who could take on phone screening and on-site interviewing responsibilities.

## Talent Management

This ties in very closely with the _Identifying and Addressing Gaps_ section above. The EM needs to have a very good handle on

- Any existing gaps within the team, either on the team as a whole or for individual employees.
- The strengths and scope-for-improvements for each employee. The EM should take this into account when assigning work to developers and also when developing goals and career growth plans for each employee.
- Succession plans within the team. For example, the EM should have a good idea about who could take on the role of the _Technical Lead_ in case the current developing in that role moves on to something else. Once again, as in the previous point, when developing goals and career growth plans for each employee, the EM should take into account where the employee currently stands and where s/he needs to be.

## Mentoring and Coaching

### Onboarding Plan for New Employees

### Helping Current Employees

### Formal Learning Plan

- Right learning tools methods
  - on the job
  - class
  - format plan with a assigned mentor

## Career Growth

- Plan for each member's professional and career growth.
- Talk to each dev about their interest and career goals.
- Where each dev current is and where s/dhe wants and/or needs to be.

### Aligning Work with Interest

- Delegating work
  - Using this as means to help devs build confidence and leadership experience.

### Creating a Growth Plan

## Having Measurable Goals

## Team Building

### Building Trust

Listening
Respecting opinions
Praise and reward
DO not micromanage

### Team Activities

## Getting and Giving Feedback

- 1-1s to discuss (measurable) goals
