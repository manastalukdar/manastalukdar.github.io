 description: "Note on an eBook for Distributed Systems."
excerpt: "I recently finish re-reading this (free and open source) e-book on distributed systems."

I recently finished reading this (free and open source) [eBook](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/) on distributed systems. It is authored by a fellow engineer in the industry. I think this e-book, while slightly dated, outlines some of the core conceptual aspects of distributed systems in a very concise form, that other literature has done so or expanded upon in forms many times larger.
