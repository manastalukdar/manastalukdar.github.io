# Distributed Systems Book - Production-Ready Microservices

I recently read the book, [Production-Ready Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053675.do). This book has some good pointers on what it takes to run "operations for live services". It is authored by an ex-Uber employee. Chapters 5 and 6 are specially relevant to Operations. Even if things like Service Operations is not of particular interest, it still makes for an interesting read from a Distributed SystemsÂ perspective, specifically what it takes to build and run a distributed systems service in production.
