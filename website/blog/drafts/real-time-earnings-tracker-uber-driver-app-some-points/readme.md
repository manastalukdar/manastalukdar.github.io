# Real-time Earnings Tracker in Uber Driver App - Some Points of Interest

Uber Engineering had a [blog post](https://eng.uber.com/real-time-earnings-tracker) recently on a real-time earnings tracker in their new driver app. In their own words:

>The Real-time Earnings Tracker, a means of showing drivers how much they have earned per trip, day, and week, among other functions.

The goal of this post is to capture some of the key points from their post, that I found interesting.

Initial release of the feature was through a minimum viable product (MVP), using that release to collect feedback and iterate.

Success of feature was measured by adoption and usage.

Effort involved cross team(s) collaboration.
