# Interviewing Engineering Managers

${toc}

## Behavioral Skills

### Communication Skills

- How well does the candidate communicate?
- How well does candidate convey technical information?
- Does candidate dive deep and into specifics?
- Is candidate concise and to-the-point?
- Was candidate able to get their point across and was responding accurately to questions. Communication can be both written and verbal; the candidate's resume is a sample of their ability to communicate in written form.
- Typically, ask the candidate to give a summary of their work experiences, focusing on last few years. Another option is to ask him to talk about their most impactful project.

### Context on Job Switch

- Why are you looking for a new job?
- Company
  - How did you hear about this company?
  - Why this company?
  - What do you know about this company?
- What are your looking for in next job? What are you looking for in terms of career growth?

### Inquisitiveness, Ability to Learn New Things and Generally Always Looking to Improve

- How do you keep yourself updated with new developments in the technological landscape?
- What is something new (technical) you have learnt recently?
- Does candidate have a mindset of continuous improvement? Does the candidate actively seek out opportunities to learn new skills? Is candidate approaching the interview process as a discussion and opportunity to learn something.

### Awareness

- Receptive to feedback for self and team.
- Exhibits ability to learn and improve.
- Has an idea of their strengths and weaknesses.

### Empathy

Has the ability to understand others' perspectives?

### Passion and Sense of Ownership

- Tell me about one technical problem you solved that you particularly recall and how did you solve it?
- Tell me about your most impactful project.

### Not Afraid to Take on Challenges

Evaluate the candidate's desire to tackle problems of significant complexity. Look for history of working on challenges projects and innovating novel solutions.

### Will Speak Up and Proffer Positive Change

- Looks for signs of candidate improving processes and proposing best practices in previous jobs.
- Does candidate make things better? Does candidate bring about positive change?
- Does candidate challenge the status-quo and proffer positive change, while doing so in a positive / diplomatic manner? Keep in mind not to confuse this with insubordination or going off in different direction or not bring a team player, which are different things.
- Will candidate bring good ideas to the table?

### Tenacity and Resoluteness

- Will candidate give up when things get tough?
- How does candidate deal with failure?

### Culture Fit

- Is candidate curious?
- Is candidate hard-working?
- Does candidate have a generally positive and can-do attitude?

## Technical Competency

### Data Structures and Algorithms

A coding exercise to test for code competency. Does not need to be at the same level as a senior IC, but candidate **must** exhibit ability to understand problem by identifying the correct algorithm. Furthermore, working code **must** be provided, even if candidate needed 1-2 hints along the way. Candidate should also be able to reason through time and space complexity.

### System Design

Candidate **must** exhibit a strong understanding of large-scale distributed systems. This may include things like consistency models, CAP theorem, retry handling, pub-sub architectures, etc. A typical way to probe for this may be to have candidate give a rundown of a relevant project from their resume. Another approach could be asking candidate about a specific distributed systems problem and seed a discussion from there touching on multiple concepts.

### How Hands-on

- Does candidate still write code, even if not daily?
- Does candidate do code reviews?
- What sort of development tickets does candidate work on?
- What percentage of candidate's time is spent on coding, design discussions, etc.?
- Is candidate interested in keeping their technical skills intact (to some degree)?

### Programming Languages of Choice and Self-Rating in Decreasing Order of Skills

Ask candidate to rate self on top n programming languages of choice. This is more of a check for self-awareness.

### Experience with Public Cloud Platforms and/or Open-Source Big-Data Technologies

Probe candidate on experience with public cloud platforms and open-source big-data technologies.

### Experience in Providing Technical Direction (even as an IC)

- Data driven decisions.
- Ability to convince others.
- Following-through.
- Dealing with setbacks.

## Managerial Skills

### Motivation – Why Manager (and not IC)

Candidate should have decided to become a manager for the right reasons. We absolutely want to avoid individuals who decide on a managerial track because they might not have been good coders, and/or they think it is easier than being an IC.

Some acceptable answers may be:

- Likes helping developers with career development.
- Likes cross-functional collaboration.
- Likes building teams.
- Likes hiring / mentoring developers.
- Likes having a sense of ownership / responsibility over a product.

### Key Values / Tenets

What are some of the key values / tenets candidate establishes in their team? In general, what is their leadership style / philosophy.

### People Leadership

#### Retaining High Performers

What is candidate's philosophy around retaining high performers? How do they go about it? Look for specific data points.

#### Handling Low / Poor Performers

What is candidate's philosophy around handling poor performers? How do they go about it? Look for specific data points. Ask for examples if any.

- Do they look for any root causes?
- Are they able to identify a potential problem before it even develops into a problem?
- Do they have a plan for helping any dev get out of a rut?
  - Dev plan – an informal improvement plan.
  - PIP (formal) - PIP should not be a way to manage a person out of the company. The candidate should truly believe that the purpose of the PIP is to help the dev get back on track. And candidate as manager should be invested in that process.
- Do they also have a point after which they are willing and able to make difficult decisions as people leaders?

#### Promoting Developers

What is candidate's process around promoting developers? What would candidate do if a junior dev who has been around for around 1.5 years in a 1:1 says that s/he would like to get promoted to a senior dev?

- Ideally, we would like to see candidate anticipate this sort of situation where they have already been working with said individual on a career development plan.
- A dev should ideally be exhibited expected signals for a level at which point they get promoted to that level, so they are set up for success.
- Candidate should exhibit an approach where they work with the dev with a specific promotion plan. Regular check-ins are necessary so that any course correction can be made if needed.

#### Expectations from a Senior Level Engineer

What attributes and signals would candidate expect from a senior level candidate in their team? In terms of technical competency, leadership, mentoring?
