# Regarding Banning of the raakShasa

The recent banning of the raakShasa, while a welcome move, is of no real consequence in the grand scheme of things. The goal should be to uproot him root and stem from his current abode in what was once the cradle of our civilization. Indeed the goal should be to address the root causes that have led to our civilizational bastions being overrun by raakShasa-s.
