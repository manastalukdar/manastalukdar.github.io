#### Reading

- **Distributed systems for fun and profit**: I recently finish re-reading this (free and open source) [e-book](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/) on distributed systems. It is authored by a fellow engineer inÂ the industry. I think this e-book, while slightly dated, outlines some of the core conceptual aspects of distributed systems in a very concise form, that other literature has done so or expanded upon in forms many times larger.

#### Work

- **Cloud Services**: I currently manage a team working on SaaS metadata solution (for industrial process data to enable asset management using context) for large scale distributed data store.

#### Other

- **Personal Website**: I recently built this website (with blog). Learnt Vue.js and Nuxt.js for this project and it was a lot of fun.
