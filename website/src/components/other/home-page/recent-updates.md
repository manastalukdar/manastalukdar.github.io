#### Reading

- **Production-Ready Microservices**: I recently read the book, [Production-Ready Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053675.do). This book has some good pointers on what it takes to run "operations for live services". It is authored by an ex-Uber employee. Chapters 5 and 6 are specially relevant to Operations. Even if Service Operations is not of particular interest, it still makes for an interesting read from a Distributed SystemsÂ perspective, specifically what it takes to build and run a distributed systems service in production.

#### Work

- **Cloud Services**: I currently manage a team working on SaaS metadata solution (for industrial process data to enable asset management using context) for large scale distributed data store.

#### Other

- **Personal Website**: I recently built this website (with blog). Learnt Vue.js and Nuxt.js for this project and it was a lot of fun.
