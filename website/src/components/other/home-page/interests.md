- **Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing**: I am interested in the design, architecture and organizational challenges of distributed systems. I enjoy working on problems around scale, data consistency, availability, reliability, and how to build and run teams that solve these problems.

- **Data Storage**: General interest around concepts involved in data storage and database technologies, specifically in the context of large scale distributed systems.

- **Building and running high performance engineering teams**: I am interested and experienced in building high performance engineering teams by hiring and retaining top talent. I follow an agile data driven approach to team management that includes close collaboration with stakeholders and mining project metadata to drive team velocity. At the end of the day, I find it gratifying to see someone I hired, mentored, coached ramp up to become a productive software engineer, building something as part of my team or a greater organization, that provides value to users.

- **Technology**: I love technology in general and I am always on the lookout for any new development in the industry that I could either learn out of personal interest, or potentially apply at work if relevant.

- **Hiking**: I love nature and like to go on hikes around the San Francisco bay area. I particularly enjoy the redwood forests in California.
