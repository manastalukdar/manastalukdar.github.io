- Created high-value engineering team that developed product which spawned v-next series of enterprise solutions.
- Successfully completed research project and developed prototype for large-scale distributed data store that I subsequently took to product stage as Engineering Manager.
- Bootstrapped multiple projects from ideation to product. Determined scope and road-map with stakeholders (including customers) and build teams that consistency delivered on committed milestones.
- Worked throughout the stack, from using front-end frameworks to develop modern web apps to back-end development including storage, access layers, API and middleware SDK. Focus and interest primarily in the back-end, specifically in distributed systems and cloud computing.
