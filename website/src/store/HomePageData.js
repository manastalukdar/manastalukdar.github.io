    'I am an engineering manager, located in the San Francisco bay area, experienced in hiring, mentoring software engineers and building and running a team. I have nearly 12 years of software engineering experience, including collaboration with users, executive leadership, product management and customer support. I am a quick learner and self-driven with proven track record in delivering projects that involved learning new technologies. My recent experience is in cloud computing and distributed systems. My current core competencies are in large scale system design and people, project management.',
  highlights: [
    'Created high-value engineering team that developed product which spawned v-next series of solutions.',
    'Successfully completed research project and developed prototype for distributed data store that I subsequently took to product stage as engineering manager.',
    'Worked throughout the stack, from using front-end frameworks to develop web apps to back-end development including storage, access layers, API and middleware SDK.'
