# An Application Template for Promotion to Staff or Lead Engineer

A Staff or Lead Software Engineer is a very senior role in the engineering organization. It is a role that requires a deep understanding of the technology stack, the ability to mentor and lead other engineers, and the ability to work with other teams to deliver complex projects. The role also requires a high level of technical expertise and the ability to solve complex technical problems. It is incumbent on engineering leadership to promote engineers to this role only when have consistently demonstrated the ability to excel in these areas. In general a promotion should only happen when the candidate is already functioning at the level of the role they are being promoted to, so that they are set up for success. This is even more important for a role as senior as Staff or Lead Engineer.
