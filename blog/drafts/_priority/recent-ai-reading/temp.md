# Temp

Review blog/drafts/_priority/recent-ai-reading/temp.md. Now, you need to update blog/2026/01/25/recent-ai-reading-29-december-2025/readme.md based on the links in the temp file. Feel free to go to those links and find out what the content is about. Based on that add each link under the relevant section of blog/2026/01/25/recent-ai-reading-29-december-2025/readme.md. If you think something may be relevant for more than one section, add it to the primary relevant section, and add the other sections similar to how I did it as "- Cross Topics: Agentic AI, Training Paradigms" under blog/2025/10/25/recent-ai-reading-25-october-2025/readme.md. If there are duplicate links under the temp file, obviously do not add those duplicates.
