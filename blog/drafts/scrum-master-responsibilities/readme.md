# Scrum Master Responsibilities

${toc}

## Overview

## Sprint Planning

### Pre-planning

Scrum masters should work with their engineering manager (and product manager where applicable) to determine the sprint drivers ahead of time. This should ideally be a result of the regular backlog review and/or pre-sprint planning meeting. The prioritized backlog or the next sprint itself should already have some tickets allocated.

### Planning meeting

During sprint planning, scrum master should allocated tickets to the sprint based on inputs from engineering manager and product manager. They should then assign these tickets to team members based on inputs from the engineering manager. Tickets allocated for the sprint should be based team capacity.

## During the sprint

Scrum master should run the daily standup. Specifically s/he should focus on, if each team member:

- is making progress with their allocated work and what they intend to work on until the next standup.
- is blocked or not and if blocked how to allow them to make progress.

Scrum master should also holistically look at the board and

- ensure that team is on track towards 100\% sprint completion.
- check if any load balancing needs to be done.

It is likely that some mid-sprint (MSA) addition may come about. In which case scrum master can

- either remove an equivalent ticket from the sprint board then itself, or
- look at [all MSAs] towards the end of the sprint and remove equivalent tickets at one go.

Scrum master should also do a checkpoint of the sprint board in the middle of the sprint and check for ant sprint completion risks.

Scrum master should also do a checkpoint of

- the sprint board and check for any sprint completion risks.
- the release specific [filter] for unresolved tickets.
- un-triaged tickets using this [filter].

Scrum master should ensure that all committed tickets have a parent epic, and assigned to the right team. You can monitor this using [Jira Plans].

## Towards the end of the sprint

Scrum master should ensure that sprint completion is 100%. Guidance for moving items to next sprint:

- If a MSA came about 1-2 days before end of sprint, and that specific item is not getting done by end of sprint, it can be moved to next sprint.
- If a ticket is pending on other ticket(s) it can be moved to next sprint.

For every ticket moved to the next sprint, there needs to be an accompanying comment.

A ticket should not be arbitrarily moved to next sprint without just cause.

During sprint retrospective, scrum master should drive discussion around sprint completion.
