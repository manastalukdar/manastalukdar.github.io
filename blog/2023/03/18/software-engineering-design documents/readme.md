# Software Engineering Design Documents

${toc}

## Overview

A software design document is an extremely important part of the software development effort. While not every development work item / stream necessarily entails a design document, engineering leaders should foster a culture where software engineers organically are able to make a judgement call on when to write a design document. A design document allows for ideas to be fleshed out in a more formal and a transparent manner. It allows for stakeholders to review and respond and to document feedback for future reference. Design documents can in some cases also act as feeders for technical / architectural documents.

This post provides a template for software design document.

### Problem Statement

### Background

### Motivation and Context

Discussion of the technical and/or business requirements / use-cases that was the motivation for this decision.

#### Use Cases / User Stories

This should typically point to a Product document and/or user stories in the Product backlog. But its is OK to provide a brief summary.

#### Functional Requirements

#### PSR^[Performance Scalability and Reliability] Requirements

PSR should be a first class citizen for all development efforts.

### Goals

### Proposal

Include any architecture / timing / sequence / component diagrams, data models, user flows, examples, code samples, etc.

#### Key Takeaways

### Potential Trade-offs and Risks

Any short-term and/or long-term trade-offs and risks.

### Alternatives

List of any alternatives that were considered with their pros and cons.

### Potential Future Work

### Summary

#### Next Steps

Who will implement, who is responsible for review, which team, etc.
