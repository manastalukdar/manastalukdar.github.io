# Software Engineering Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

${toc}

## Overview

Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a point-in-time log entry of a design and/or architectural decision. This is usually the result of a pointed decision / discussion rather than a played-out design review process. ADR should also typically only address a specific problem / concern and it should be concise and lightweight as compared to design documents.

There is a certain inter-play between ADR, ùó•ùóôùóñ (Request for Comments) and design documents. Sometimes ADRs are used as feeders for RFCs, but that is not necessary a hard and fast rule.

We will discuss RFC and design documents in separate posts. This post outlines a template for capturing a ADR.
