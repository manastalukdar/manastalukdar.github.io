# Breaking into AI/ML

I often get asked how to break into AI/ML. This question comes from industry professionals as well as students and/or new graduates. Here is a rough guide that includes building a foundation and also getting some practical experience:

1. Do Machine Learning [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) in Coursera. [Mandatory]
2. Do Generative AI with Large Language Models [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) from Coursera. [Mandatory]
3. Do some of these [short courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/) at DeepLearning.ai. After `1.` and `2.` above, you will know which ones are more important. [Mandatory]
4. Do Deep Learning [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) in Coursera. This is a significant time commitment. [Optional]
5. Try to break into something _AI_ related at work. Does not have to be pure AI. Could be data science enablement, data analytics, etc. This can happen immediately after step `1.`.
6. Regardless of `5.` it would be worthwhile attending some local/virtual meetups on AI/ML. I would check [meetup.com](http://meetup.com/).  This can happen immediately after step `1.`.

Once you have these on your resume, doors will start to open for AI/ML roles.
