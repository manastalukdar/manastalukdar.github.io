# Breaking into Data Engineering

I get asked by individuals on some mentoring forums about how to break into data engineering. This post is a collection of resources and ideas that I have proffered to answer this question.

1. Courses
   1. [Big Data Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data) in Coursera offered by UC San Diego. [mandatory]
   2. [ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow and Kafka](https://www.coursera.org/learn/etl-and-data-pipelines-shell-airflow-kafka) course in Coursera. [mandatory]
   3. [Advanced Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-engineering) course in Coursera. [mandatory]
   4. [IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer) program  in Coursera. This is a 13 course program that covers a wide range of topics in data engineering. It will be a significant time commitment. However, if not this whole course, I definitely recommend doing the "ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow and Kafka" course linked above which is part of this program. [optional]
2. YouTube Channels [[ref](https://dev.to/seattledataguy/8-great-data-engineering-youtube-channels-21n7)]. I recommend watching videos from these channels to immerse yourself in the world of data engineering and pick up as many concepts as possible in as quick a time. While it will be overwhelming in the beh=ginning, stick through it. It will start making sense after a while.
   1. [Data Engineering Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnfZSN7A09wNwYiUoincXZg)
   2. [Data with Zach](https://www.youtube.com/c/DatawithZach)
   3. [Andreas Kretz](https://www.youtube.com/c/andreaskayy). Related website: [Learn Data Engineering](https://learndataengineering.com).
   4. [Darshil Parmar](https://www.youtube.com/c/DarshilParmar)
   5. [Seattle Data Guy](https://www.youtube.com/c/SeattleDataGuy). Related website: [The Seattle Data Guy](https://www.theseattledataguy.com).
   6. [Karolina Sowinska](https://www.youtube.com/c/KarolinaSowinska)
   7. [mehdio DataTV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiZxJB0xWfPBE2omVZeWPpQ)
   8. [E-Learning Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearningBridge)
   9. [Ken Jee](https://www.youtube.com/c/KenJee1)
3. Books
   1. [Fundamentals of Data Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781098108298/) by Joe Reis, Matt Housley. [mandatory]
   2. [The Data Engineering Cookbook](https://cookbook.learndataengineering.com) by Andreas Kretz. [mandatory]
   3. [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) by Martin Kleppmann. This book is slightly dated, but still extremely useful. [optional]
4. Meetups: Try attending some local/virtual meetups on data engineering. I would check meetup.com.
5. Conferences: Attend some data engineering conferences. You should summarize your learning and sessions from these conferences. This will be a good talking point in interviews. Do not hesitate to send a thank you note to a speaker whose session you enjoyed. This will help you build a network.
   1. I would check out the [Data Council](https://www.datacouncil.ai) conferences.
   2. Databricks has a conference called [Data + AI Summit](https://databricks.com/dataaisummit).
   3. Big Data World has a conference called [Big Data World](https://www.bigdataworld.com).
6. Podcasts [optional]
   1. [Data Engineering Podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com).
   2. [The Data Engineering Show](https://www.dataengineeringshow.com).
7. Freelancing jobs: Try to get some freelancing jobs on data engineering. This will help you build a portfolio and get some real-world experience. You can check out websites like Upwork, Freelancer, Fiveer, etc.
