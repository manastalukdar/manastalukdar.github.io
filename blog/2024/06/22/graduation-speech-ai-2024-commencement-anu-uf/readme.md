# Graduation Speech on AI at 2024 Commencement Ceremony of the American National University and University of Fairfax

I was honored to deliver the graduation [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQXnush_qrA&t=789s) on Artificial Intelligence at the 2024 commencement ceremony of the American National University and University of Fairfax. I spoke about how AI is transforming the world and how the graduates can contribute to this transformation. I also shared my journey and the lessons I learnt along the way. It was a truly inspiring experience, and I wish all the graduates the best of luck in their future endeavors.
