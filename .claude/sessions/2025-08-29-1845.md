### Update - 2025-08-29 18:52

**Summary**: Fixed PWA stale cache issue with recent posts list

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: website/app/pages/index.vue, website/app/stores/BlogMetadata.ts, website/nuxt.config.ts
- Added: .claude/sessions/2025-08-29-1845.md  
- Current branch: source (commit: 527e1c323 Fix.)

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Reduce localStorage cache duration from 5 minutes to 30 seconds
- ✓ Completed: Improve PWA cache invalidation strategy  
- ✓ Completed: Make home page blogMetadata reactive to store changes
- ✓ Completed: Add navigation-based cache refresh logic

**Details**: 
- **Problem**: Recent posts list on home page showed stale data in PWA unless hard refreshed
- **Root Cause**: 5-minute localStorage cache + PWA service worker caching with poor invalidation
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced localStorage cache to 30 seconds
  - Updated PWA cache to refresh every 30 seconds (1-minute expiration)  
  - Made home page data reactive with computed()
  - Added logic to force refresh when navigating from blog sections
- **Result**: Recent posts now update immediately when users navigate from blog pages back to home

### Update - 2025-08-29 19:07

**Summary**: Enhanced cache strategy to always show fresh data on home page regardless of navigation path

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: website/app/pages/index.vue, website/app/stores/BlogMetadata.ts
- Current branch: source (commit: 527e1c323 Fix.)

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Remove navigation detection logic from home page
- ✓ Completed: Always fetch fresh data on home page mount
- ✓ Completed: Keep caching for same-session performance  
- ✓ Completed: Test the changes work as expected

**Details**: 
- **User Request**: Ensure no stale data on home page regardless of navigation source (direct load, non-blog sections, etc.)
- **Previous Solution Limitation**: Only forced refresh when coming from blog sections
- **New Approach**: 
  - Removed `isFromBlogSection()` navigation detection logic entirely
  - Home page now always calls `setupBlogMetadata(true)` to force fresh data fetch
  - Maintained 30-second localStorage cache for same-session performance in other components
- **Verification**: Build completed successfully, all optimizations intact
- **Result**: Users now see latest recent posts on every home page load, no exceptions
