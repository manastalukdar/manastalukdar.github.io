# Development Session - 2025-08-13 13:55

## Session Overview
- **Start Time**: 2025-08-13 13:55 UTC
- **Project**: Personal Website & Blog (Nuxt 4 + Vue 3)
- **Branch**: source

## Goals
Fix CI failure in blog metadata generation caused by draft-only changes triggering unnecessary processing

## Progress
### ✅ Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue**: CI detected blog changes but failed metadata generation
- **Cause**: Modified draft post (`blog/drafts/_priority/recent-ai-reading/readme.md`) with `published: false`
- **Problem**: CI change detection didn't distinguish between draft and published content

### ✅ Investigation Results
- Draft posts are correctly excluded from metadata processing via `ignore=shutil.ignore_patterns('*.gitkeep', 'drafts')`
- CI generated empty metadata `[]` when no publishable posts changed
- Metadata generation itself worked correctly - issue was in change detection logic

### ✅ Long-term Fix Implementation
**Updated `.github/workflows/main.yml`:**
1. **Enhanced Change Detection**: 
   - Filter out posts in `/drafts/` folders
   - Check frontmatter for `published: false` 
   - Only trigger processing for publishable content changes
   
2. **Improved Logging**:
   - Clear distinction between draft and published changes
   - Informative messages when skipping draft-only changes
   
3. **Optimized Processing Mode**:
   - Added `use-cached` mode handling for no publishable changes
   - Prevents unnecessary metadata regeneration

### ✅ Testing
- Verified logic correctly identifies draft-only vs published changes
- Confirmed workflow will skip metadata processing for draft-only commits
