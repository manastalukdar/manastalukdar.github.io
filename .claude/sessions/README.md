## Naming Convention

Session files should follow the pattern:
`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-descriptive-name.md`

Example: `2025-08-11-0805-caching-improvements.md`

## Usage

When starting a new session with `/session-start`, consider including the feature area:
- `/session-start blog-post-navigation`
- `/session-start homepage-testimonials`  
- `/session-start performance-optimization`

This helps organize sessions by functional area and makes it easier to find related work.
