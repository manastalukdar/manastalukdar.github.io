### Update - 2025-08-12 14:56 PM

**Summary**: Fixed CI build failure in getRoutes.ts

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/sessions/.current-session, website/app/utils/getRoutes.ts
- Added: .claude/sessions/2025-08-12-1456.md
- Current branch: source (commit: 1f24c88)

**Todo Progress**: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Examine the getRoutes.ts file to understand the author lookup issue
- ✓ Completed: Check how authors are being loaded and resolved
- ✓ Completed: Fix the undefined author reference causing the build failure
- ✓ Completed: Test the fix locally to ensure it resolves the CI issue

**Details**: 
- **Issue**: CI build was failing during "Install Node Dependencies" step with error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')" in getRoutes.ts:153
- **Root Cause**: Missing safety checks when filtering tags and categories by URL slugs, causing attempts to access `.name` on undefined array elements
- **Solution**: Added safety checks in both tags and categories sections to skip processing when no matching items are found
- **Testing**: Verified fix works with both `npm run postinstall` and `npm run build` completing successfully
- **Files Changed**: Enhanced `website/app/utils/getRoutes.ts` with defensive programming patterns
