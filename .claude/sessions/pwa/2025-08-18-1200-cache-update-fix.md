## Progress

### Update - 2025-08-18 12:30 PM

**Summary**: Fixed PWA caching mechanism and implemented comprehensive update system

**Git Changes**:

- Modified: website/app/app.vue, website/app/utils/contentHash.server.ts, website/nuxt.config.ts
- Added: website/app/components/PWAUpdateNotification.vue, website/app/plugins/pwa-update.client.ts, website/public/_headers
- Current branch: source (commit: 4db1af449)

**Todo Progress**: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending

- ✓ Completed: Add _headers file for GitHub Pages cache control
- ✓ Completed: Configure service worker cache invalidation with shorter TTLs
- ✓ Completed: Add cache-busting for service worker and manifest files
- ✓ Completed: Implement forced update detection in PWA
- ✓ Completed: Add user notification system for PWA updates
- ✓ Completed: Test PWA update mechanism

**Issues Encountered**:

- Build failed initially due to workbox configuration issue with `cacheKeyWillBeUsed` plugin structure
- Three missing tree-shaken icons warnings (mdi-brain, mdi-filter, mdi-lightbulb)

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Cache Headers**: Created `_headers` file with no-cache policies for service workers and appropriate cache controls for different asset types
2. **Service Worker Enhancement**:
   - Reduced cache TTLs (blog metadata: 5min→3min, markdown: 1hr→30min, testimonials: 30min→15min)
   - Changed `CacheFirst` to `StaleWhileRevalidate` for faster updates
   - Added `clientsClaim: true` and cache versioning (v2 suffix)
   - Added timestamped cache keys for blog metadata
3. **Update Detection System**:
   - Created PWA update plugin with 5-minute interval checks
   - Service worker lifecycle monitoring
   - Automatic update detection on focus/visibility changes
4. **User Notification**:
   - Material Design 3 snackbar notification component
   - User-controlled update process with loading states
   - Integrated into main app layout
5. **Cache Invalidation**:
   - Enhanced content hash system with stable hash generation
   - Fixed workbox plugin structure for proper cache key manipulation

**Code Changes**:

- Enhanced PWA configuration in `nuxt.config.ts` with better caching strategies
- Added comprehensive PWA update detection and management system
- Created elegant user notification system for PWA updates
- Implemented cache headers for GitHub Pages deployment optimization

## Notes

PWA update system is now comprehensive and should resolve the issue where local installed PWAs weren't updating properly. The solution balances performance (appropriate caching) with freshness (forced revalidation for critical files).

### Development Narrative

#### Key Accomplishments
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified that aggressive PWA caching with GitHub Pages default cache headers was preventing PWA updates from being detected by installed apps.

2. **Comprehensive Caching Strategy**: Implemented a multi-layered approach:
   - GitHub Pages cache headers via `_headers` file
   - Service worker configuration optimizations  
   - Client-side update detection and notification system

3. **User Experience Enhancement**: Created an elegant, non-intrusive update notification system that gives users control over when to apply updates.

#### Features and Fixes Implemented
- **Cache Control Headers**: Service workers and manifests now have no-cache policies while static assets maintain appropriate caching with revalidation
- **Enhanced Service Worker**: Reduced TTLs, changed to StaleWhileRevalidate strategy, added cache versioning
- **PWA Update Plugin**: Automatic update detection every 5 minutes with service worker lifecycle monitoring
- **Update Notification Component**: Material Design 3 snackbar with user-controlled update process
- **Content Hash System**: Enhanced with stable hash generation for deterministic cache busting

#### Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **Build Failure**: Initial workbox configuration error with `cacheKeyWillBeUsed` plugin structure
   - **Solution**: Wrapped plugin in proper structure with `plugins` array

2. **Missing Icons**: Three tree-shaken icons warnings (mdi-brain, mdi-filter, mdi-lightbulb)
   - **Status**: Noted but not addressed (non-critical warnings)

3. **Cache Invalidation**: Original PWA system wasn't detecting content changes
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive cache busting with timestamped keys and proper versioning

#### Lessons Learned and Tips
- PWA update mechanisms require careful balance between performance (caching) and freshness (updates)
- GitHub Pages has default caching policies that can interfere with PWA update detection
- User-controlled updates provide better UX than forced refreshes
- Service worker lifecycle events are critical for proper update detection
- Content-based versioning is more reliable than timestamp-based versioning

### Project Impact

#### Configuration Changes Made
- Enhanced PWA configuration in `nuxt.config.ts` with optimized caching strategies
- Added cache control headers for GitHub Pages deployment
- Integrated PWA update plugin into application architecture

#### Dependencies Added or Removed
- No new dependencies added (used existing Vuetify and Nuxt PWA modules)

#### Breaking Changes
- None identified

#### Work Planned but Not Completed
- Missing icon warnings could be addressed by adding the three icons to utils/icons.ts
- Could enhance notification styling or add more update options in future

### Deployment Steps
- Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
- Changes ready for deployment to GitHub Pages
- No additional deployment steps required beyond normal CI/CD pipeline

### Future Development Notes
- Monitor PWA update effectiveness after deployment
- Consider adding more granular update options (e.g., background updates)
- May want to add analytics to track update adoption rates
- Consider implementing update scheduling for less disruptive user experience
