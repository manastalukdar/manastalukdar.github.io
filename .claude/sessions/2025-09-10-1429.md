## Goals and Objectives
Fix CI static site generation failure where blog posts were trying to access readme.md files via URL instead of local filesystem, causing 404 errors during `npm run generate`.

## Progress

### Issue Analysis ✅
- **Root Cause**: Blog post page component was falling back to URL fetch when filesystem reading failed
- **Specific Problem**: Path mismatch between metadata (`"path": "2025/09/09/post/readme.md"`) and actual file location (`website/public/blogdata/2025/09/09/post/readme.md`)
- **Context**: During static generation, the server-side code couldn't find files due to path resolution issues

### Solution Implementation ✅
1. **Enhanced File System Reading**: Updated `website/app/pages/blog/[year]/[month]/[day]/[post].vue` with robust path resolution:
   - Added multiple path attempt strategies for different deployment contexts
   - Handles both CI (project root) and local dev (website directory) scenarios  
   - Strips `blog/` prefix from metadata paths when needed
   - Falls back gracefully to URL fetch only if all filesystem attempts fail

2. **Route Configuration**: Added `/blogdata/**` route rule to Nuxt config to ensure static files are served correctly during generation

### Testing ✅
- **Local Build**: Successfully tested `npm run generate` 
- **Verification**: Confirmed problematic post `/blog/2025/09/09/kyle-corbett-openpipe-ai-agents-rl-fine-tuning/` generates without errors
- **Performance**: Generation completed in ~1.3 seconds per blog post

### Files Modified
- `website/app/pages/blog/[year]/[month]/[day]/[post].vue` (lines 183-217)
- `website/nuxt.config.ts` (lines 443-447)
